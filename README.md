# Marcus's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository was created to showcase my progress through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate as I journey into the cybersecurity field. It contains course-based summaries, project artifacts, and labs from the first six courses of the certification program.

Each course folder includes writeups, the skills I developed, and links to relevant documents. Youâ€™ll also find my resume and other supporting files in subfolders.
