# Course 3: Linux and SQL

## Key Skills
- Navigating file systems and modifying permissions with `chmod`
- Reading and interpreting Linux permission strings
- Writing SQL queries for log filtering and investigation

## Highlight: Linux Permissions
In a hands-on exercise, I audited file permissions, such as removing unauthorized write access from hidden files to ensure the principle of least privilege.

## Highlight: SQL Filtering
I wrote SQL queries to filter failed login attempts, isolate events on specific dates, and exclude some geolocations to support incident triage.
