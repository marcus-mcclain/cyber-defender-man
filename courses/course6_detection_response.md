# Course 6: Detection and Response

## Key Skills
- Incident detection utilizing logs and other tools such as VirusTotal
- Documenting and simulating escalating security incidents
- Writing response plans congruent with NIST CSF

## Highlight
I investigated a phishing ransomware attack and documented the 5 W's (Who, What, When, Where, Why) using an incident handlerâ€™s journal. I also analyzed a file hash in VirusTotal and documented a response strategy.
